MP1 For Alejandro Suazo and Patrick James Deavers

Hey Internet!

I just want to be clear about a few things:

1.) This is a project for class and a grade.

2.) The purpose of this is to log my progress and to hopefully enable others/guide them in the right direction.

MOST IMPORTANTLY
3.) I will not hesitate to expose others who try to pass this work as their own for their own grade. This is for viewing purposes only.
  - I submit my work before committing the finalized version online (so you'll always have the finalized version after my grade has been given).
  - I have logs that both github creates and the metadata of my local copies that can attest to my work.
  
  If you do try and cheat by submitting this as your own work (copy and paste, clone, etc...) good luck with your academic career.
  Respective professors know of my work and have access to my repositories, so that'll be fun to explain! ;)
  
  Aggies do not lie, cheat, or steal nor tolerate those who do.
